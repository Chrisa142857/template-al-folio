üëã I'm **Ziquan Wei** (È≠èÊ¢ìÊ≥â in Chinese). A researcher and PhD student supervised by [Dr. Guorong Wu](https://www.acmlab.org/team) at UNC-Chapel Hill. I'm meanwhile the system administrator at [ACMLab](https://www.acmlab.org). Previously, I obtained a Master's degree supervised by [Prof. Shaoqun Zeng](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9B%BE%E7%BB%8D%E7%BE%A4) and a Bachelor's degree supervised by [Prof. Yang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7JLPFHgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interests are graph learning, brain modeling and decoding, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.
